On November 29 I took part in online hackathon "Югорский Хантатон". During it, our command developed a web application for interactional city tours. It is called KOMAP

I was a member of S.S.H&K.K. command. Besides me, there were 4 more members: Artem Stukalov as a backend developer, Timofey Sedov as a frontend developer, same as me, Dariya Kuznetsova and Victoria Kruk as designers.

This is an application description from the project repository:

> The main idea is to create routes passing through the sights of the cities of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug (in particular Khanty-Mansiysk), along which people will be invited to walk. The routes will pass not only through the sights but also through cafes, shopping centers, etc. At the end of the route, people will be able to leave reviews, and after passing 3 basic routes they will be able to create their own, which will subsequently be moderated and added to the site as "new routes". We plan to cooperate with stores and coffee houses to build routes through them, thereby creating an unobtrusive advertisement. At the end of the route, we will provide discount coupons from partner stores, thereby we will be able to interest more people.

During the hackathon, we developed this idea, implemented a backend service for this application and a landing page presenting our product. Currently, this project is still not finished, but not abandoned. We took first place in the junior league and got a lot of new experience.
